<h2>Tugby</h2>
<h3>Sunday 30th August 2020</h3>

<br>
<h4></h4>
<p>There was a choice of walk this week. Eight walkers chose to drive up to the Peak District whilst three of us including new walker Alan mark 2, went for the more local option. The club had done this route not so long ago in Otober 20018 but this didn't matter as this is a very enjoyable walk with spectacular views. 
  
 </p>
<p>We started the route in Hallaton which would leave us handily placed for a post-walk drink at the Fox Inn. This meant we reached Tugby around lunch time and we discovered to our delight that the Cafe Ventoux was open. I have done this walk several times and this is the first time that this cafe has been open. It is big draw for cyclists as it is on a national cycle route, and we had to queue up to get served as it was so busy.

</p>  

<p>After our lunch break, we completed the route and were in the pub by 4pm.
